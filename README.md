Looking at ESPN leagues to analyze the role of luck and how well decisions were made during the year

This may be slightly confusing in format, but I am a huge fan of ipython notebooks. If you have any questions please reach out to me here or on my stackoverflow as well. 

The in season analysis pulls from espn fantasy football using selenium so there are some inputs people must make to access the data orgininally. Also the data for expert rankings must be downloaded and formated in the same way I used otherwise the script will not run properly. Please look at my blog post on LinkedIn, to see the analysis I did. There may be issues from when I went back to delete data due to privacy concerns.

The random league playoff perc file looks at random public ESPN leagues to find out how many wins are needed for a bye and to make the playoffs. I believe some of the results are taken from here and used in the main file because the code there depends on it. If you have questions you cannot answer then please reach out to me here, on stackoverflow, or any other channel you would like.
